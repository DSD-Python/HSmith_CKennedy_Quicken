The goal for this project is to provide users with the ability to analyze the financial data of their bank statements for the purposes of budgeting and financial planning. The target user is anyone who would like to make informed financial decisions by analyzing their spending and earning patterns. 

As of now, the software allows users to upload their bank statements. It then pulls out certain data from these statements including the users' categories of spending and earning, the specific places where they have spent or earned money, and the dates of these transactions. It then produces several graphs which the user may find helpful for analysis of their spending. 

To use our software is simple:
  Step 1: 
  
Main Elements: To Be Completed

We encrypt the file that is created by our software. However, our software requires the user to download their bank statements onto their computer. While we do not possess any of the user's data, security risks are present whenever one downloads sensitive data to their computer. For example, someone with malicious intent could gain remote access of the users computer and gain access to their files. To mitigate this risk, it is important to use computers with advanced malware protection systems, such as Apple computers.

Additional work that could improve this project is making it more user-friendly and visually appealing.
